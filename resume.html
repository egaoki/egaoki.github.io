            <h2>My Study Abroad Experience </h2>
              <p>During my junior year of college, I studied abroad for a year at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. I can easily say that going abroad in a whole new country was one of the most rewarding experiences of my time in college so far. Scroll down or click the icons below to see some of my adventures! </p>

        <p> Growing up half-Japanese, learning about my mother's culture and language was something I looked forward to everyday. I began attending Keisho Center, a language school located in Bethesda for Japanese heritage speakers, in elementary school until high school. I am currently pursuing a B.A Japanese major at the University of Maryland and have had the opportunity to have studied abroad at Waseda University in Tokyo.  </p>
